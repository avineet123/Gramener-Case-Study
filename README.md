# Gramener-Case-Study
## Problem Statement
### Introduction
In this case study,after applying EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) i need to have basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.

### Business Understanding
You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision: <br />
  1.If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company <br />
  2.If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company <br />
 The loan data contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
 In this case study, i am using  EDA to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
